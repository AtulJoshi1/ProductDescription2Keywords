Most widely used approaches use topic modelling i.e. LDA or NMF for finding keywords from a large corpus of documents. But, to get more meaningful, descriptive, precise and fine-grained keywords corresponding to a product description or review document, a little more specific approach is needed.

Extracting Search Engine Appropriate Keywords and Key Selling Points from a Product's description in E-Commerce Websites<br>
**Problem Statement:  Extract from mobile phone description dataset**

**1. Search Engine Appropriate Keywords**

**2. Key Selling Points**<br> <br>


## 1. Extracting Search Engine Appropriate Keywords: <br>
 

### Proposed Approach: 
&nbsp;Search engine appropriate keywords can be:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;a. Specific : eg. Samsung Galaxy, Flip cover, Redmi note 3, etc. i.e. proper nouns

  &nbsp;&nbsp;b. General :Features such as: Smartphone, earphone, tangle free earphone (nouns other than proper)

 

### Solution: POS tagging + TFIDF + ngram

&nbsp;For each document :

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extract Noun/ Proper nouns from preprocessed (stopwords+ lemmatization) text.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join the extracted words to make a new document (pos_filtered_doc)

&nbsp;On list of pos_filtered_docs:

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apply ngram TFIDFVectorizer and for each document extract words with top-n TFIDF value.<br> <br>



## 2. Extracting Key Selling Points:
 

### Proposed Approach:<br>
Key selling points can be treated as general, but little more descriptive, quantified features eg. 1.3ghz processor, bezel less screen, 24 hr battery backup, octa core processor

### Solution: <br>
Extract the noun phrases from the original document, corresponding to the keywords found in the previous step (i.e keyword extraction phase) .
